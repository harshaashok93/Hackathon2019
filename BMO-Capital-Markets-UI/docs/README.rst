General Documentation
****************************************

Welcome to **GALE-Website**'s documentation.  This document will provide you with a high level overview of this project.

GETTING STARTED
===============

Hey there and welcome to **GALE-Website**'s documentation.  Hopefully you will be able to find some answers here.  If you have already completed the `quickstart`_ and are still looking for more info, this is the place.  Below you will find a little more information about the *quickstart* process.

server side

**TBD**

More info to follow

**Favicon**

The favicon is configured to be served in two way for this project:

* ``config/urls.py``
* ``link`` tag in ``base.html``

The reason for both is browser behavior can be strange for favicons.  This is an extra measure to help make sure that the favicon is handled correctly.  For more information read `Fail Proof Favicons`_.

**error pages**

This project comes with templates for ``400``, ``404`` and ``500``.  I have provided urls in the ``config/urls.py``.  You can test the 500 page while in development, but if you want to test the ``400`` or ``404`` pages, you will need to set ``DEBUG=False``

http://localhost:8000/500

Keep in mind that when you are styling these, it is good practice to keep the styles and javascript inline just to be safe.

**Overextends**

This third party django templating helper is added by default with this project.

**Customize Wagtail Admin**

This project comes with the templates required to customize the pages for the wagtail admin site.  There are four templates:

*branding_logo : base.html*

.. code-block:: html


    {% block branding_logo %}
        <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/custom-logo.svg" alt="Custom Project" width="80" />
    {% endblock %}


*branding_favicon : admin_base.html*

.. code-block:: html


    {% block branding_favicon %}
        <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/favicon.ico" />
    {% endblock %}


*branding_login : login.html*

.. code-block:: html


    {% block branding_login %}Sign in to Frank's Site{% endblock %}


*branding_welcome : home.html*

.. code-block:: html


    {% block branding_welcome %}Welcome to Frank's Site{% endblock %}

client side

**TBD**

More into to come later

**.eslintrc**

This is the file that allows you to set specific rules for eslint.  As a default, I have configured it to follow the ES6 style guide proposed by airbnb.  To make adjustments, add them to the ``rules`` property.

The only rule change imposed is to allow the JS to have 4 spaces.

This section describes how to deploy this project


Contributing
============

This section outlines how you want people to contribute to your project.

Git Workflow: Forking and Branching
-----------------------------------

All contributors will Fork and Clone a copy of the official repository.  Run through the following steps:

Lead Developer:
...............

1.  Initialize a new bare repository
2.  Create a development branch
3.  Add working project to master
4.  pull working code to development branch

Contributors:
............

1.  Fork the project repo
2.  Clone a copy of the forked repo

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://user@github.com/user/repo.git

4.  Add remote Repositories (The location of the official repo)

.. code-block:: bash

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/maintainer/repo

5. When each contributor works on a new feature, they create a new branch based off their local main repo branch

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b your-feature master

6. Contributors work in this feature branch then when they are satisfied with their code, or the main branch has moved forward, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull --rebase upstream development

8.  When ready to commit the branch - push to your public fork

.. code-block:: bash

    git push origin your-feature

10. Make a PR

Git Workflow: Feature Branch Naming Conventions
-----------------------------------------------

Please use dashes for names, not underscores or camel case:

.. code-block:: bash

    // bad :(
    your_feature

    // bad :(
    yourFeature

    // good :)
    your-feature
